# Predictiong Electricity Consumption

In a time when electricity prices are increasing, having a way for governements and ministries to be able to predict the consmumption is a good option.
A good prediction leads to better management of the resources, especially in a small country, full of natural resourses.
This is a small project on my take on this topic.
